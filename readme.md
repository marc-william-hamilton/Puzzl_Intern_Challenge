# Puzzl Intern Challenge
I built a rock-paper-scissors game in Python.
- the user enters their choice
- their opponent makes a choice at random
- a winner is displayed.

After making a `git clone` of this repository and `cd` into it, the game can be played in either of two modes:

## Web Mode
The web mode requires the Flask library. It can be installed with
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
and then
```bash
python3 FlaskApp.py
```
The local address where the game is run can be viewed in the terminal.

## Terminal Mode
```bash
python3 RockPaperScissors.py
```
